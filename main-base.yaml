    ---

    ### **Section 3: Tech & Market News (Short & Scannable)**

    * Provide one link for the main info and a second "deep dive" link (a Gemini search query) for more details.

    * **Major Red Hat Releases:**
        * [1-sentence summary of the latest RHEL or OpenShift announcement] - [Link to Announcement] - [Gemini Deep Dive]"

    ### **Section 4: Task List**

    "Take the full output of the 'Detailed Daily Briefing' and parse it. Extract *only* the actionable items and format them as a simple, exportable task list.

    Each task should include:
    1.  The task itself (e.g., 'Review Q4 budget proposal').
    2.  The source (e.g., 'Email from [Sender]' or 'Calendar: [Meeting Name]').
    3.  The due date, if specified (e.g., 'Due: EOD Friday').

    Do not include any summaries, news, or general announcements. The list should be formatted cleanly so I can copy-paste it into a task manager."
