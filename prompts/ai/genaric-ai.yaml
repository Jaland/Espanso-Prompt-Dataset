      * Generate a short, one-sentence summary for each topic below.
      * Provide one link for the main info and a second "deep dive" link (a Gemini search query) for more details.

      ### **Section 4: Task List**

      "Take the full output of the 'Detailed Daily Briefing' and parse it. Extract *only* the actionable items and format them as a simple, exportable task list (don't include calendar invites).

      Each task should include:
      1.  The task itself (e.g., 'Review Q4 budget proposal').
      2.  The source (e.g., 'Email from [Sender]' or 'Calendar: [Meeting Name]').
      3.  The due date, if specified (e.g., 'Due: EOD Friday').

      Do not include any summaries, news, or general announcements. The list should be formatted cleanly so I can copy-paste it into a task manager."
